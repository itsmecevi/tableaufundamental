**Connect to and Customize Data: Connecting to Data**

**Objectives:**

* Identify the types of data Tableau can connect to.
* Describe Tableau's default (live) connection to data and its impact on visualizations.
* Explain the process to connect to a data source.
* Describe the role of the data grid in editing metadata.

1.  Tableau data connections

    * `Types of data connections`
    * `Live connections vs. extracts`

2. `Connect to a data source`

3. Explore connected data:
   * The Data Source page
   * Manage metadata
   * Metadata grid
   * The Tableau workspace
   * Refresh live data
  
4. Try it! Connect to a data source:
   * Connect to the Excel file, data_connection_practice.xlsx.
   * Rename the data source to "My Orders Data".
   * Load the Orders sheet.
   * Change these field names: Row to "Row ID" and Global Area to "Country".
   * Change the data type for the Country field to the geographic role of Country/Region.
   * On the Sheet 1 worksheet, open a field's dropdown menu to view customization and other options there.

In this module, you learned about types of data source connections and the difference between a live connection vs. an extract. 
You got familiar with options on the Data Source page as well as in a Tableau worksheet. 
You connected to a single data source, an Excel file, and loaded its data into Tableau. 
Last, you saw how you might edit field metadata before working with the data to build a viz. 
Now, you should feel ready to try this with a data source of your own.
